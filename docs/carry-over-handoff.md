# Pinky Brain Carry-Over Handoff

Status: READY FOR NEW CHAT

Repo path: ~/Desktop/pinky-brain
Remote: https://github.com/aarupme/Pinky-brain.git

Current clean checkpoint:
- main equals origin/main
- working tree is clean
- loop is stopped
- beacon is stopped
- command candidate is cleared
- dry-run returns no-candidate
- latest commit: 296f6e0 Add Pinky status dashboard command

Hard workflow rules:
- l means: lets go and look; wait briefly, inspect terminal state, report success/failure/in-progress, then give next single safe command only if needed
- no heredocs
- no long fragile inline quoted commands
- no commands that open interactive pagers
- use git --no-pager for git log/diff
- one command at a time
- inspect before patching
- preserve safe terminal/process discipline

Pinky vocabulary:
- Narf! = Pinky automated continuation token
- k/K = manual kill switch
- 🐭 = safe continuation available
- 🧠 = Brain/human decision required
- 🛑 = hard stop
- # 🐭 pinky-run = runnable command intent marker
- # 👀 pinky-ready = command block complete marker

Validated capabilities:
- pinky-send sends messages to ChatGPT
- pinky-mode on/off controls runtime
- pinky-loop handles 🐭, 🧠, 🛑 with safety gates
- Pinky now sends Narf! instead of l
- command detect/extract/classify/dry-run/manual-run exists
- manual command runner has audit logging

Recommended next workstream:
WS10 — Runtime Hardening: Local Kill Switch + Log Compaction

Goal:
Implement and document the next safe runtime hardening slice: inspect current k/K kill-switch support, decide the smallest local-safe implementation path, and improve operator readability without introducing auto-execution or destructive side effects. Preserve manual control, no background command execution, no pager, and one-command-at-a-time workflow.
